# audit

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

An interactive application that ushers you through the inspection and analysis of your growth curve experiments.

## Example

![alt text](eg.gif)

To start a new AUDIT session:

```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
audit::run()
```

## Installation

Audit is currently only available on github and can be installed like any other
remote r package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("npjc/audit")
```

#### Step-by-step

1. Install [R][] by downloading the appropriate package for your operating system from [cran][] and following the onscreen instructions.
2. Install [Rstudio][] (Optional), a development environment for R by downloading the appropriate image for your operating system from Rstudio's [download page][] and follow the onscreen instructions.
3. If this is a new R installation you will need to download some packages before being able to install audit. To do this, open R / Rstudio and enter the line below into the console. Follow the onscreen instructions.

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "tidyverse", "remotes"))
```
4. Install AUDIT and its dependencies by entering the line below into the console

``` r
remotes::install_github("npjc/audit")
```

5. To run AUDIT enter the line below at the console. This will open a new session in your default web browser.

```r
audit::run()
```

## More Info

### What is AUDIT?

AUDIT stands for  **A**utomated **U**sher for **D**ata **I**nspection and **T**idying (**AUDIT**). As in it helps you audit your growth curves.

AUDIT is really just an interactive interface to multiple modules. These modules are also openly distributed as R packages:

- [readcg12][]
- [readgp1][]
- [readyg][]
- [readbioscreen][]
- [growr][]
- [mtpview][] (and as a current workaround to known issue [mtpview1][])

### If you find a bug

As you use AUDIT, if you find bugs, file an issue (ideally with a reproducible example) at <https://github.com/npjc/audit/issues>. If you are unsure how to make your example reproducible: provide input data used and a description of the steps used or a link to a video demonstrating it.

### Known Issue

The only change from previous communication is that mptview currently exists as 2 separate packages (mptview and mtpivew1). This is a temporary workaround for a bug in the underlying grid graphics system. I will fold the mtpview1 back into the normal mtpview in the next R release (grid is shipped with base R, more info). 

### Experimental tag

The explore section is tagged as `experimental` as I will add new views beyond what is already there. Once I have added all the views I will remove the experimental tag. 

### Additional Functionality Elsewhere

Earlier versions of this tool were used as prototypes and made publically available through the  [shinyapps.io][] service. These are still freely accesible via web browser (no installation needed).

- [cg12report][] provides the ability to download a .pdf report of cg12 formatted data

- [audit-lite][] provides interactive plate view where you can add reference line plots onto all wells of the plate (powered by [d3][] via [r2d3][]).

### Absolutely No Guarantees

I have tried my very hardest to ensure that the software performs as intended. I use the same underlying tools for my own work. I however make absolutely no guarantees about the use and or results of AUDIT and its associated software. I therefore encourage you to validate your assumptions and check your work.

### Alternatives and Prior Work

There are a number of other tools that may provide similar and/or other useful functionality (in no particular order):
